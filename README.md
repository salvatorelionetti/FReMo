Fridge Remote Monitor

This is an Android App focused to monitor a fridge by:
* verifing the power status
* verifing the temperature inside the fridge.

First condition is possible keeping the phone plugged to AC power cord, near the fridge;
Second condition is possible by reading temperature from the SensorTag CC2750.

Definitively a way to reuse an old phone with Bluetooth Low Energy (ble).

It use blen library, available at https://github.com/salvatorelionetti/blen
